The salt state in question can be used easily. All you have to do is setup a salt-master and salt-minion architecture.
You can do this on Ubuntu by using the following commands:

On the master:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install salt-master
hostname -I

# Keep the hostname in mind or write it down.

On the minion:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install salt-minion
sudoedit /etc/salt/minion

Inside of the /etc/salt/minion file you will write the following:

master: (the IP address of the master that you found out with hostname -I)
id: (the name you want the master to see your minion as)

sudo systemctl restart salt-minion.service

After you restart the salt-minion with the command you need to execute these commands on the master computer.

The n the master:

sudo salt-key -A

After you're asked if you want to proceed:

y

Now that you've installed salt properly you can go to your /srv/salt directory.
You can navigate directories with the ls and cd commands for example if you're in the /srv directory you can get to /srv/salt
by using cd salt.

In the salt directory you'll create a directory that you can name by yourself by using the following command:
sudo mkdir (the name you want for the directory)

Inside of the directory you'll create an sls file and open it by using the following command:
sudo nano init.sls

Now inside of the init.sls file you're going to write the following text:
